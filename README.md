  <h1>Book Bridge Website</h1>
</div>

## USAGE :

Seen many unprivileged students to find books they want but eventually can't buy them because they don't have money. Ofcourse you can find them easily online but to read from a screen 
and to read from the actual page there is a huge difference. So I made this charity based website where :
- If you have any books that you don't use anymore add them in the website.
- Needy person will contact and chat with you for the availability of the book.

## Website Features :
- Authenticate a user [ via Login and register ]
- Logout a user
- Upload books and the image of it in a dedicated user profile
- Which books have been uploaded by a specific user
- All the books that're currently uploaded to the website
- Chat with the specific user whose book you want
- Keeping track of users you have interacted with
- A page to give feedback
